# Part 1

Implement a quick search functionality as part of a larger app (i.e. not expecting this to be a standalone component) based on the following [**Figma wireframes**](https://www.figma.com/file/gQVK0BCychWR9itVUIFxoq/Practical-task?node-id=0%3A1).

Design a modern UI/UX on top of that.

Utilise the following libraries to the extent that you think is suitable:

- React
- Redux
- styled-components

Use the [**Penguin Random House book search API**](http://www.penguinrandomhouse.biz/webservices/rest/).

- Update the results in real-time as user types
- Be mindful of (perceived) performance
- Link results to Amazon search

Share the completed work in a public git repository. Send link via email.

# Part 2

Follow-up technical interview for you to explain your process and thinking behind any decisions.

Further QA.
